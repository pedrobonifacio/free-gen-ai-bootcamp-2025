## Business Requirements:

Add value to the language school by providing a digital robot teacher accessible to students anytime, enabling enhanced learning experiences without the need to hire additional instructors.

## Functional Requirements:

The system must possess teaching capabilities across multiple areas of language learning, including speaking, writing, and listening.

## Assumptions

We are assuming that the Open-source LLMs that we choose will be powerful enough to run on hardware with an investment of 10-15K.

We're just going to hook up a single serve in our office to the internet and we should have enough bandwidth to serve the 300 students.

## Data Strategy

There is a concerned of copyrighted materials, so we must purchase and supply materials and store them for access in our database.

## Considerations

We're considering using IBM Granite because its a truley open-source model with training data that is traceable so we can avoid any copyright issues and we are able to know what is going on in the model.
