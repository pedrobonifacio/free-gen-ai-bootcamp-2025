    ## 🔍 Clues and Considerations
	•	The verb “to see” needs to be in the past tense for the question.
	•	The question “Did you see” is usually structured differently in Portuguese, without an auxiliary verb.
	•	“This morning” should be placed before or after the main clause.
	•	“They were looking” suggests an ongoing action in the past. You need the correct verb tense for that.
	•	“Our garden” includes a possessive adjective, which must agree in gender and number with “garden.”
	•	The verb “to look” in this case is being used with a preposition, meaning “to look at something.”
